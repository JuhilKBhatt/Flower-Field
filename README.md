# Procedural Generation

Description: Its a procedural generating flower field using only three.js. You are able control the flower count, flower height and petal count. You can also click on the field to create a petal flying effect. All the petal's colour is generated randomly (Petal Effect and Petal on Flower). The Petals Size are also randomly generated to emanate nature and the petals are generated in a circle, meaning if generated with 3 petals, they will be spread evenly.
